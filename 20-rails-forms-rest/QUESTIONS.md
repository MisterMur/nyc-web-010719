Can you drop in db:drop a single table???

What does a rails dev do?
- most of it is magic, they wave a wand, things happen
- they basically learn the framework

Limitations to Rails vs other frameworks?
- scaling => Twitter
- Rails => probably want to control the full stack
  - React => SPA
    - API
    - TurboLinks
  - Django => Django Rest Framework => API
  - Node.js
- Go Lang => really good at parallelization and scaling

Active Record => Data Mapper

Keep an open mind => use the right tool for the right job.
