    - nice layers, protocols, conventions all this nice stuff...
    - hobbled together house of cards
  - HTTP 2.0, 3.0 => most clients/servers don't have it on

## Lecture Notes

How the lectures evolve in Flatiron.
- generally, mod 1, the lectures are before your labs
- in mod 2, labs come first, lectures begin turning into reviews
- mod 3, it's all reviews

In Mod 2, you want to understand:
=> background, the logic behind the internet and web servers
=> the patterns they're slowly abstracting out
  => conventions => RESTful Routes, MVC

The Internet is a cobbled together mess.
